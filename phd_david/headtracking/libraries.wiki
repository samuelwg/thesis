=== libfreenect ===

* Web: [http://openkinect.org/wiki/Main_Page]
* Git: [https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect]
* My fork: [https://github.com/vokimon/libfreenect]

* User space drivers that provides access to Kinect's depth and rgb data, tilting motor and led status.
* It includes wrappers for opencv, python, c++...
* Fist stages, still evolving
* Posted some patches to C++, python and opencv wrappers as we tested it
* Quite invasive asynchronous API, added a more convenient synchronous timestamped api lately

To build cmake local install
{{{
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/local/ -DBUILD_PYTHON=ON -DBUILD_CV=ON -DPYTHON_SITE_PACKAGES=~/local/lib/python
$ make install
}}}

=== OpenNI ===

* Web: [http://www.openni.org/]

* Official drivers provided by the Kinect manufacturer.
* Apache license (open and closable)
* Besides access to the buffers, it provides hooks for detection modules
* Detection modules are provided just as binaries :-(
* Git full of windows bin blobs.
* Need more research. I should monitor its evolution for openness

* Three components: 
** Framework (OpenNi)
** Hardware middleware (PrimeSense Sensor)
** Detector middleware (PrimeSense NITE)

* Install OpenNi

{{{
git clone https://github.com/OpenNI/OpenNI.git
cd OpenNi
git checkout -b unstable
git rebase origin unstable
cd OpenNI/Platform/Linux-x86/CreateRedist
./RedistMaker
cd ../Redist/
sudo ./install
}}}

Interesting remotes:
{{{
git remote add 
}}}

* Install Sensor

{{{
git clone https://github.com/OpenNI/Sensor.git SensorKinect
cd SensorKinect
git branch unstable
cd SensorKinect/Platform/Linux-x86/CreateRedist
./RedistMaker
cd ../Redist/
sudo ./install
}}}

Interesting remotes:
{{{
git remote add ros https://github.com/ros-pkg-git/Sensor.git
git remote add avin https://github.com/avin2/SensorKinect.git
}}}


* Install NITE, license: 0KOIk2JeIBYClPWVnMoRKn5cdY4=
