Found those lectures on 3D analysis:
http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall03/cs597D/lectures/

Some notes follows:

Problems addressed:
Feature Detection: robustly finding geometric features in a 3D model
Segmentation: decomposing a 3D model in its parts
Labeling: identifying each part in a model??
Registration: aligning features of 3d models for comparison
Matching: computing a measuring for similarity
Retrieval: finding models that best match a query model
Recognition: finding a given model from a database
Classification: determining the class of a model (kind of object)
Clustering: learning classes of models without supervision


Medial axis, shock graph or skeleton: Locus of the centers of the circles which are tangent to the surface.

Edit distance between two models: Num of ops to lead a model to another, being the ops:
- Splice: deletes a branch and join the remaining ones at the branch point
- Contract: delete the branch between two 3-degree nodes
- Merge: combines two branches at a 2-degree node
- Deform: changes the attributes of a branch
