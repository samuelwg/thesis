== Excess filter ==
\label{sec:lateral}

This section uses the previous results to quantify
the situation described in the introduction and
illustrated in figure \ref{fig:ambisonicsVsDirectSound}.
We shall compare the filter resulting from decoding a plane wave with a given Ambisonics order and decoding
criterion, against the filter resulting from using only one loudspeaker along the 
plane wave direction.

Excess filter for an ipsilateral plane wave
using several orders and decodings: max-$r_V$ (top), max-$r_E$ (center) and in-phase (bottom)

To this end, left ear signals $c^{L}$ resulting from the general
equation \bref{equivalent-formula} are computed by
using the analytical expressions in the time \bref{eq:spherical_3d} and 
frequency domain \bref{ap:Components3DFrequency}. 
Figure \ref{fig:sphereDelayFilters} shows the resulting filters
for a plane wave at fixed incoming angle,
and for various Ambisonics orders and decoding criteria,
For ipsilateral plane waves, the filtering is stronger at low Ambisonics order,
and milder at higher orders, where the decoding tends to give
more and more importance to the loudspeaker along the incoming angle.

Figure \ref{fig:singleOrderEncodingDifferentOrientations}
shows the plots for first order, and different incoming angles.
On these plots, can be seen that ipsilateral incoming orientations
are the ones with less attenuation while the ones which are obstructed by the head
exhibit a comb-like filtering behaviour.

Filter variation depending on the orientation of the plane wave relative to the head.
-90 degrees means ipsilateral to the considered ear, 90 is contralateral and 0 degrees, front or back.
max-$r_V$, max-$r_E$ and in-phase 1\textsuperscript{st} order decodings are shown
