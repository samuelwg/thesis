Abstract:

In Ambisonics decoding all loudspeakers participate in reproduction
even for highly directional sound fields.
The presence of the listener's head at the sweet-spot
affects differently the signals arriving from each loudspeaker,
thus distorting the acoustic field reconstruction at both ears. 
While this does not necessarily affect localization cues,
it does create an unwanted filter which is clearly noticeable,
specially when reproducing frequency-rich content like music. 
Such degradation is particularly present in binaural signals obtained from Ambisonics,
a procedure which simulates a perfect setup in terms of loudspeakers and listener placement.
This paper presents a novel formalism
for studying and quantifying this effect and its dependence on
the Ambisonics order,
decoding scheme used, and
listener's head radius.
Exact analytic expressions are obtained under particular approximations
that capture and quantify the main features of the filter.

== Introduction ==

Ambisonics is a technology for recording, encoding, manipulating and decoding three-dimensional acoustic fields, 
based on the decomposition of the pressure field in spherical
harmonics~@cite:cooper1972_discreteMatrixMultichannelStereo,gibson1972compatible,Gerzon_Patent,Gerzon_Periphony,Gerzon_Soundfield,montoya2004high,Gerzon_Broadcasting,Malham_BformatManipulation,Gerzon_VienaDecoder,Wiggins_Phd.
First-order Ambisonics, or B-format, is the most used version of the technology; it is based
on 4 audio channels, corresponding to the signals that would be recorded by four coincident 
microphones: an omni-directional one, and three orthogonal figure of eight microphones. 
Higher order spherical harmonics are needed to gain information in a 
neighbourhood about the recording point, leading to the concept of Higher Order Ambisonics (HOA) @cite:Daniel_Phd,
which is known to provide larger optimal listening areas,
at the cost of requiring more channels
@cite:poletti2000_UnifiedTheoryHorizontalHolographicSoundSystem,bertet20063d,solvang2008_SpectralImpairment2DHOA. 
% : $(l_{max}+1)^2$ in 3D, or $2l_{max}+1$ in 2D. 
Ambisonics can also be decoded to binaural format by first decoding to a given virtual loudspeaker layout, and
then convolving the signal of each loudspeaker with the corresponding Head Related
Transfer Function (HRTF) (e.g. @cite:Wiggins_Phd,Noisternig_binauralAmbisonics).

One characteristic feature of all Ambisonics decoders is that all loudspeakers participate in the reproduction,
even for highly directional sound fields.
For example, for a plane wave incoming from a given angular direction,
an in-phase homogeneous first order decoder would send the same signal
to all loudspeakers, weighted by a factor corresponding to a cardioid pattern with maximum along the direction
of arrival (see \autoref{fig:ambisonicsVsDirectSound}).
Although, at first sight, this feature might be expected to destroy the main cues required for 
localization~@cite:Martin_CannotWork it is well-known that this is not necessarily the case~@cite:Fons_DoesWork, as
shown in plenty of Ambisonics implementations, and extensively discussed in the Ambisonics literature @cite:bertet2007HOAAcuracyTests.

Within Ambisonics, all loudspeakers contribute to the decoding of even the most directional sound field.

However, there is one effect caused by this characteristic feature that is clearly noticeable, 
specially in low-order Ambisonics decoders.
No matter how well a decoder is optimized, the ears
of a listener located at the sweet-spot are inevitably 
located about 10 cm away from it, and therefore,
copies of the same signal are received, 
with different delay, gain, and head-diffraction effects.
When summed mathematically, 
this leads to comb filter like effects which are more noticeable,
and indeed annoying, when listening to binaural conversions of
Ambisonics signals, specially for frequency-rich musical content. 
This effect is due to the limited angular resolution that lower-order Ambisonics provides, and it progressively
disappears at larger Ambisonics orders (see fig \ref{fig:flatWaveDecoding2d}).

One goal of the work presented here is to quantify this effect and study its dependence on the
Ambisonics order ($l_{max}$) used, the decoding criterion, and the head radius. 
With this aim, the article first develops a mathematical formalism for dealing with existing algorithms to convert Ambisonics to binaural.
The concept of {\it HRTF field} as a real map defined on the sphere
@cite:abhayapala2007_horizontalPlaneHrtfFourierBessel,evans1998_hrtfSphericalHarmonics is introduced,
and it is shown that the spherical harmonics of the HRTF field are the 
quantities that appear naturally in the Ambisonics to binaural conversion. 

By exploiting this formalism, exact analytic expressions are obtained
that quantify the aforementioned harmonic components of the HRTF field
under a limited set of approximations.
These results are then exploited to study the excess filter effect
in one specially illustrative case: the comparison between
\begin{enumerate}
\item  a single sound at a given angular position rendered using the corresponding HRTF pair of functions,
\item  the same sound first encoded into Ambisonics, and then converted from Ambisonics to binaural.
\end{enumerate}

Section~\ref{sec:realistic_conditions} analyses the impact of the idealizations
used to obtain exact results, by comparison with the corresponding filters 
obtained from measured HRTFs.
Conclusions and future applications of the results and formalism presented here
can be found in section~\ref{sec:conclusions}.
