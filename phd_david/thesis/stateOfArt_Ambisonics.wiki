Ambisonics is a technology for recording, encoding, manipulating and decoding
three-dimensional acoustic fields,
based on the decomposition of the pressure field in spherical harmonics.
It was firstly formalized by Gerzon in @cite:Gerzon_Periphony,
althought its based on ideas previously published by
@cite:cooper1972_discreteMatrixMultichannelStereo
@cite:gibson1972compatible and 
@cite:Fellgett1972_directionalInformation
and others.



=== Spherical harmonics ===

* Why: explain conventions and properties used along the thesis
* Informal definition:
** Family orthogonal functions defined on the surface of an sphere.
** They can be used as base to represent any
*** orientation dependant function
*** as a linear combination of them
** Analogy: Fourier decomposition
*** for functions defined in the circle vs in the sphere surface
*** fourier used sinusoids
*** Azimuthal and elevation frequency
* Harmonics and components have two indexes: order l and degree m
** In a given order l, degrees go from $-l$ to $l$
** Some conventions take out the sign as a third parameter $\sigma$
** Warning: just real or also complex
** Components grow quadratic with the order $l^2$
** Each order l adds $2l-1$ components
* Harmonics in the same order have the same number nodal lines
** Parallel or elevation nodal lines ($l-|m|$)
** Meridian or azimuthal nodal lines ($|m|$)



* Components in each order are rotational invariant
** Components of no other order paricipate on the rotation of a given order
*** 
* De
** Several conventions
*** Real and Complex
*** Normalizations
*** Phase
*** Channel normalization
