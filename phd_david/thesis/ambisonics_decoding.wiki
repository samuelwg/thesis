== Formalism of Ambisonics to binaural conversion ==
\label{sec:ambisonics}

This section briefly reviews the aspects of Ambisonics coding and decoding relevant to this paper,
and then formalizes the existing decoding techniques to binaural, 
by introducing the concept of HRTF field, 
and its corresponding spherical harmonics expansion.

=== Ambisonics decoding=== 

For the sake of simplicity, only regular layouts are considered, ''i.e.''
a set of \nspeakers\ loudspeakers regularly inscribed on a sphere. 
The symmetry of the array simplifies the decoding by reducing the number of independent coefficients.
For example, for a first order decoder to a regular 3D layout, the most general linear decoding formula @cite:Daniel_Phd is
\be
\label{first_order_decoding}
c_i = g_0 W + g_1 \left[  X \cos e_i \cos a_i + Y \cos e_i \sin a_i + Z \sin e_i \right]  \sac i=1,...,N_L \,,
\ee
where $c_i$ is the signal to be sent to channel $i$,
$(a_i,e_i)$ are the azimuth and elevation of each loudspeaker, in the coordinate system shown in figure~\ref{fig:ambisonicsConvention};
and $g_0, g_1$ are the gains for the zeroth and first order components $\{W,X,Y,Z\}$.


Similarly, the most general order $l_{max}$ Ambisionics linear decoding formula to 3D regular layouts is 
\be
\label{generic_decoding}
c_i = \sum_{l=0}^{l_{max}} g_l \sum_{m=0}^l \sum_{\s=\pm} A_{l,m,\s} Y_{l,m,\s} (a_i,e_i)   \sac i=1,...,N_L \,,
\ee
where $A_{l,m,\s}$ is the Ambisonics $(l,m,\s)$-channel, and $Y_{l,m,\s} (a,e)$ the spherical harmonics.
Note that regularity of the layout forces the gains $g_l$ ($l = 0,....,l_{max}$) to depend only
on the order $l$, but not on $m$ nor $\s$. 

The choice of the gains $g_l$  depends on the physical and psychoacoustic criterion chosen @cite:daniel1998ambisonics. 
Some of the most popular choices are:
''max-$r_V$', which optimizes for low-frequencies;
''max-$r_E$', which optimizes for high-frequencies; and 
''in-phase', which attempts to avoid sending out-of-phase signals to the loudspeakers and maximizing the listening area.
The coefficients derivable from these criteria can be found, for example, in \protect\cite{Daniel_Phd_decodingTable}.


=== Ambisonics to binaural: the HRTF field ===

This section briefly reviews the standard conversion of Ambisonics to binaural signals,
also described in @cite:Wiggins_Phd,Noisternig_binauralAmbisonics,
and introduces a formalism to organise the conversion that will be very convenient in the next sections.
The organisation follows from the fact that
HRTF's are impulse response functions typically evaluated over a sphere about the
listener's head, for fixed listerner's head position. 
Therefore, the time domain HRTFs can be thought as a field defined on
\bea
\calr \times \cals^2 & \rightarrow &  \calr \nn
t  \times  a,e & \rightarrow &  H(t,a,e) \,,
\eea
where $t$ is the time coordinate, and $(a,e)$ are the azimuth and elevation coordinates that parameterise the sphere.
As any function defined on $\cals^2$, the angular dependence of the HRTF field can be expanded
in spherical harmonics @cite:Zhang2009_ModalExpansionHrtf,
\bea
H(t,a,e) &=& \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} \sum_{m=0}^l \sum_{\s = \pm}
H_{l,m,\sigma} (t)  Y_{l,m,\sigma}(a,e) \,.
\eea
Here, $H_{l,m,\sigma} (t)$ are the time-dependent ''spherical harmonic components of the HRTF field'', $H(t,a,e)$. 
Conversely, the HRTF spherical components can be easily extracted out of the HRTF field via a standard
projection formula:
\bea
H_{l,m,\sigma} (t) &=& {1\over 4\pi} \int d\Omega \, \, H(t,a,e) \,   Y_{l,m,\sigma}(a,e) \,,
\label{projection}
\eea
where $d\Omega = \cos e \, \textrm{d}a \textrm{d}e$ is the differential solid angle on the unit sphere.

Having a continuous density of source positions is an ideal case that
will enable the attainment of analytical expressions
without losing of the essential properties, as shown in section \ref{sec:realistic_conditions},
For discrete layouts, consisting of regularly placed loudspeakers, 
all integrals over the sphere should be replaced by discrete sums:
\be
\label{discretization}
{1 \over 4\pi} \int d\Omega \, \, f(a,e)  \,\, \rightarrow \,\, {1\over N_L}\, \sum_{i=1}^{N_L} \, \,  f(a_i,e_i) \,.
\ee


We shall now prove that the binaural conversion of an Ambisonics signal
containing a set of $(l,m,\s)$ components
only requires knowledge of the corresponding $(l,m,\s)$ components of the HRTF field. 
Ambisonics to binaural conversion@cite:Noisternig_binauralAmbisonics is
typically done by first decoding to a given loudspeaker layout,
and then by convolving each channel with the corresponding HRTF measured at the loudspeaker position
(figure ~\ref{fig:ambisonics2BinauralDiagram}). 

Figure: fig:ambisonics2BinauralDiagram figures/ambisonics2BinauralDiagram
A standard two-steps Ambisonics to binaural decoder.

The resulting left/right channels $c^{L/R}$ can be expressed as:  
\bea
c^{L/R}(t) &=& {1 \over 4\pi} \int d\Omega \,\,\,  c(t,a,e) * H^{L/R}(t,a, e) \,.
\label{amb2bin}
\eea
Here, $c(t,a,e)$ is the decoded signal for the loudspeaker at azimuth $a$ and elevation $e$, and
$H^{L/R}(t,a,e)$ are the left/right ear HRTF fields evaluated at the same position. 

\ignore{\footnote{Under the assumption of a left-right symmetric head, 
$H^R(t,a, e) = H^L(t,-a, e)$,
equations can be further simplified considering just one of the ears.
Because the symmetry properties of the spherical harmonics:
$H_{l,m,\s}^R(t,a,e)=\s H_{l,m,\s}^L(t,a,e)$, so,
spherical harmonics components with $\s=+1$ are the same 
for left and right ears 
while components with $\s=-1$ just invert the sign.}}

Substituting \bref{generic_decoding} into \bref{amb2bin},
and using linearity of the convolution operation, leads to:
\bea
c^{L/R}(t) &=& 
{1 \over 4\pi} \int d\Omega \,
\left[ \sum_{l=0}^{l_{max}} g_l \sum_{m=0}^l \sum_{\s=\pm} A_{l,m,\s} (t) Y_{l,m,\s} (a,e) \right] * H^{L/R}(t,a, e) \nn
&=& 
\sum_{l=0}^{l_{max}} g_l \sum_{m=0}^l \sum_{\s=\pm} A_{l,m,\s}(t) *
\left[  {1 \over 4\pi} \int d\Omega \,
Y_{l,m,\s} (a,e)  H^{L/R}(t,a, e) \right]  \nn
&=& 
\sum_{l=0}^{l_{max}} g_l \sum_{m=0}^l \sum_{\s=\pm} A_{l,m,\s}(t) *
H_{l,m,\sigma}^{L/R} (t) \,,
\label{equivalent-formula}
\eea
where the last equality follows from \bref{projection}.

The final expression \bref{equivalent-formula} is the main result of this formalism,
generalizes first order expression obtained in @cite:Wiggins_Phd
and it provides a simple way of understanding the Ambisonics to binaural conversion: 
simply convolve each of the Ambisonics channel with the corresponding spherical harmonic 
component of the HRTF field, and add up all the resulting convolutions weighted with the 
gains $g_l$ of the chosen psychoacoustic criterion.

Besides, equation \bref{equivalent-formula} facilitates the study of the filtering
due to the effect of the head, via Fourier Transform of the HRTF spherical harmonic components. 
Section \ref{sec:analytic} derives exact analytic expressions
for these components under certain approximations.




\subsubsection*{Example: First order expressions.}

Before moving on, it might be clarifying to first consider the application of the above discussion to 
the binaural conversion of first-order Ambisonics. In such case, the four B-format channels are
\be
W = A_{0,0,+} \sac X = A_{1,1,+} \sac Y = A_{1,1,-} \sac Z = A_{1,0,+} \,.
\ee 
Similarly, the only relevant spherical harmonics components of the HRTF field are
\bea
H_W^{L/R} &=& H_{0,0,+}^{L/R}  \,=\, {1 \over 4\pi} \int d\Omega \, H^{L/R}(a, e) \,,\nn
H_X^{L/R} &=& H_{1,1,+}^{L/R}  \,=\, {1 \over 4\pi} \int d\Omega \, H^{L/R}(a, e) \cos e \cos a  \,, \nn
H_Y^{L/R} &=& H_{1,1,-}^{L/R}  \,=\, {1 \over 4\pi} \int d\Omega \, H^{L/R}(a, e) \cos e \sin a  \,, \nn
H_Z^{L/R} &=& H_{1,0,+}^{L/R}  \,=\, {1 \over 4\pi} \int d\Omega \, H^{L/R}(a, e) \sin e  \,.
\label{first-order}
\eea
Finally, the Ambisonics to binaural conversion equations are simply:
\bea
c^{L/R} &=& g_0 W*H_W^{L/R} + g_1 \left[ X * H_X^{L/R} +  Y * H_Y^{L/R} + Z * H_Z^{L/R} \right] \,.
\eea
