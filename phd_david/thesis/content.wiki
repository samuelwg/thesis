\section{Context and purpose}
\section{Contributions}

 TODO: This is a bare compilation as i recall them
* Analytic expressions for 2d and 3d HRTF S.H. components
* Applied to the problem of binaural Ambisonics decoding excess filtering
* Demonstrated why it sound that bad
* Compared analytical expressions with measured ones
* TODO: Besides the filtering, objective cues remain
* TODO: Compensation strategy `H_0^{-1}`
* TODO: Subjective tests: Compensation strategy removes cues?
* TODO: Subjective tests: Quality among plain binaural, uncompensated, and compensated
* TODO: Subjective tests: Does it sounds better vs. direct binaural

\section{Binaural reproduction}


* Our acoustic field perception is based on two signals, one at each ear so
** One approach to reproduce the same sound field experience:
*** record or synthesize such signals and then, reproduce it with headphones
** Binaural recording using (ear inserted microphones) on subjects or mannequin
*** :-( How to do synthetic?
*** :-( Not able to manipulate
*** :-( Personal

* Is a linear system so:
** record IR from a position on the space to the ear (HRTF)
** and convolve whatever sound with it
** will match the same result as recording the source from that position

* Record HRTF databases for a discrete set of sample positions, usually at a single distance
* Recording methods:
** Whole dome
** Turnable speaker
** Turnable subject



* Binaural recording vs HRTF
** HRTF allows synthetic sound fields
* HRTF is discrete
** interpolation
*** liniar
*** delay extracton + liniar
*** based on spherical harmonics
** cross fade

* HRTF is personal
** stereotypes
** biometric closest match 
** matching biometric parameters with hrtf features
* head movement
* single source

* HRTF can be learnt, visual cues reinforce them
* Crosstalk systems
* Virtual speakeer systems



\section{Ambisonics}

* Spherical harmonics
* Encoding and decoding
* Different formalisms compared
* Truncation error bounds
* Effect of angular sampling


\section{Other}

* Continuous speaker synthesis
* HTRF interpolation using SH
