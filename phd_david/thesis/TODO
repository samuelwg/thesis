= User tests i would like to do =

* Ability of learning to localize foreign HRTF
** Establishing distance with own HRTF
*** Biometric measures
*** HRTF measurement (hard, maybe selective measurement)
*** Do untrained localization tests using foreign HRTF and none of the supposed cues:
**** No head movements
**** No source movements
**** No visual cues
** Training enabling reference cues
*** Azimuthal head movements
*** Elevation head movements
*** Source movements
*** Visual cues
*** Indirect visual cues (showing
*** Combinations
** Restrained testing after trained


* Effect of the head movements on the hrtf
** Why: Not as just rotating the whole subject as the body, which affects the hrtf, does not rotate
** Measure HRTF with the neck jawed, pitched, and rolled
** Compare them relative to head and relative to body

* Whole sphere hrtf measurements
** Why: current databases lack of the bottom positions and it is required to compute SH

* Effect of the distance on hrtf
** If considered plane wave both ears have the complementary incidence angles
** But in near sources ear incidence are not that complementary anymore
** Test1: Approximate along source to ear channel instead of source to head center
*** See how the spectral shape vary
** Test2: Simulate incidence discrepancy with
