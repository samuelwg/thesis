=== HRTF spherical harmonics in 3D layouts ===

The computation of the filters for 3D arrays of loudspeakers proceeds parallel to the previous
computation for 2D arrays. Using the projection equation \bref{projection} and
modelling the HRTF field with the delay corresponding to a spherical head, the HRTF spherical
components are derived from
\bea
\label{d3-generic}
H_{l,m,\s}(t) = {1 \over 4\pi} \int_{S^2} d\Omega \, Y_{l,m,\s}(a,e) \delta(t-\tau_{arr}(\phi(a,e))) \,.
%\int_0^{2\pi} \, da \espai \rightarrow \espai {1\over 4\pi} \int_{S^2} d\Omega \,.
\eea
Due to the complexity added by the more complicated dependency of the spherical harmonics in 3D, it
is convenient to evaluate these integrals in a different coordinate system. 
Rather than using the standard azimuth-elevation angles (depicted in figure \ref{fig:ambisonicsConvention}), let us define a new
coordinate system obtained after a rotation of $-90$ degrees about the
$x$-axis, as shown in fig.~\ref{fig:convenienceCoordinatesFor3dAnalytic}.
In the new system, we shall define azimuth and elevation coordinates,
labeled $(\ta,\te)$ respectively, in a standard way with respect to new axes $\{\tilde{X},\tilde{Y},\tilde{Z}\}$,
{\em i.e.}:
\bea
\tilde{X} = \cos \te \cos \ta \sac
\tilde{Y} = \cos \te \sin \ta \sac
\tilde{Z} = \sin \te  \,.
\eea

Rotated coordinate system that defines new angles $(\ta,\te)$, in terms of which the calculations for 3D arrays simplify.


The virtue of the new system is that in terms of these coordinates,  $\phi = \te + \pi/2$; in other words, 
the angle between the left ear and a given loudspeaker at position $(\ta,\te)$ does not depend on its
azimuth $\ta$. Thus, using the following factorization of the spherical harmonics,
\bea
Y_{l,m,\s}(\ta,\te) &=& \sqrt{2l+1} \tilde{P}_{l m}(\sin \te)\, y_{m,\s}(\ta) \sac
\nn
y_{m,\s}(\ta) &=& \cos(m \ta)  \sac \mbox{if } \s=+ \sac
\nn
y_{m,\s}(\ta) &=& \sin(m \ta) \sac \mbox{if } \s=- \mbox{ and } m \ge 1 \sac
\eea
where $\tilde{P}_{l m}$ is the Schmidt semi-normalized associated Legendre polynomial of degree $l$ and order $m$,
the integral about the azimuth angle in \bref{d3-generic} factorizes:
\bea
\label{eq:component3dIntegral}
H_{l,m,\s}(t) &=&
{ \sqrt{2l+1} \over 4\pi}
\int_0^{2\pi} \, d\ta \, y_{m,\s}(\ta) 
\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} d\te \cos\te \, \tilde{P}_{l m}(\sin \te)
\,  \delta(t-\tau_{arr}(\te + \pi/2))
\nn
&=& {\sqrt{2l+1} \over 2} \delta_{m,0} \, \delta_{\s,+}  \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2}  d\te \cos\te \, \tilde{P}_{l m}(\sin \te)\,  \delta(t-\tau_{arr}(\te + \pi/2))
\,.
\eea
All spherical harmonic components vanish except those with $m=0$ and
the remaining integral can be computed analytically,
\bea
H_{l,0,+}(t) &=& 
{ \sqrt{2l+1}  \over 2 t_0}
\left[ P_l \left( {t \over t_0} \right) \u(t+t_0) \u(-t) +
\cos  \left( {t \over t_0} \right)   P_l \left( \sin\left[{t \over t_0} \right] \right) \u(t) \u(\frac \pi 2 t_0 -t)
\right] \,.
\label{eq:spherical_3d}
\nn
\eea

As in 2D, the frequency domain expressions can also be obtained analytically
(see appendix \ref{ap:Components3DFrequency}).
Figure \ref{fig:analyticalComponents3D} shows the amplitude
of the first five non-zero HRTF components. 
The spectral shape shares similarities with the 2D counterparts,
including the predominant peak spaced $1/t_0$ from one order to the next.
High frequency decay is 6dB per octave, as it can be derived from the analytic result,
so it is more pronunciated than in 2D components.

Spherical harmonics components $\tilde{H}_{l,0,+}$ of the HRTF field in 3D, for a spherical head of radius 8.8 cm.

There is another important result that can be derived from the exact formula~\bref{eq:spherical_3d}: the fact
that each order is affected by only one filter.
Alhough this is manifest in the modified coordinate system $(\ta,\te)$, which leads to 
one single non-zero HRTF component for each order $l$,
the same holds true in all Cartesian coordinate systems.
The reason is that the spherical harmonic functions
furnish irreducible representations of the rotation group $SO(3)$.
This implies that, 
when obtaining a new set of coordinates by rotating the Cartesian frame, 
the HRTF spherical components combine among themselves in a very particular manner:
for a given order $l$, the HRTF components in the new frame are linear combinations 
of old HRTF components {\em with the same $l$}.
The coefficients of the linear combinations depend on the angles $\alpha_i$ of the specific rotation.
Therefore, it can be concluded that HRTF components in any frame can be written as
\be
H^{new}_{l,m,\sigma} (t) = k_{l,m,\sigma}(\alpha_i)  \,\, H_{l,0,+} (t) \,,
\ee
where $k_{l,m,\sigma}(\alpha_i)$ are constants, and $H_{l,0,+} (t)$ is given by eq.\bref{eq:spherical_3d}.
This result simplifies significantly the expression for final binaural signals~\bref{equivalent-formula}:
\bea
c^{L/R} &=&  
\sum_{l=0}^{l_{max}}  H_{l,0,+} (t) \, * \, 
\left[
g_l \sum_{m,\sigma} k_{l,m,\sigma}(\alpha_i) \, A_{l,m,\s}(t) 
\right] \,,
\label{eq:one_hrtf_to_rule_them_all}
\eea
which shows that all Ambisonics components in a given order $l$ are affected by one single filter when converting to binaural.
This fact can be useful to design viable strategies to compensate for the excess of filtering, as discussed in the conclusions.
