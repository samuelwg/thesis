		This paper reports on the development of a system to characterize the geometric properties of a space from an acoustic impulse response measured within it. This can be thought of as the inverse problem to the common practice of obtaining impulse responses from either a real-world or a virtual space. Starting from a measured or synthesized impulse response in an original scene, the method described here defines a space of possible scenes and a distance measure on it, and discusses a strategy to select a scene from this space, which is perceptually as close as possible to the original one. Potential applications of this novel method include audio forensics, re-equalization and re-mixing of music and audio.
