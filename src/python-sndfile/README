TODO:
	Handling different physical np layouts
		use a view, assert or reshape
	sndfile command interface
	Seeking
	Use extension to deduce main format
	Use main format to deduce subformat


Existing alternatives (what i like an dislike):

- Standard wave module:
	http://docs.python.org/library/wave.html

	I think this is the main reason why there are many
	wrappers around. The standard module to do wave file
	loading is crap.

	Based on sndfile but it just writes .wav files.
	It lacks support for floating point samples, patch provided
	but ignored see http://bugs.python.org/issue1144504
	getX() instead of properties.
	no numpy integration

- scikits.audiolab
	git clone https://github.com/cournape/audiolab
	Cython based + python layer
	Dual interface: matlab like and OO
	Property accessors to samplerate...
	Numpy integration
	Inplace processing?
	Not in Ubuntu
	Within a big library

- pysndfile
	http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/pysndfile/
	It is a Swig based wrapper.

- libsndfile-python
	http://code.google.com/p/libsndfile-python/
	svn checkout http://libsndfile-python.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ libsndfile-python-read-only
	in cpython
	numpy support
	cpython purely wraps the library
	wrappers build the interface
	double layered lib and pythonic interface (not that pythonic but supports numpy)
	Implements command

- libsndfilectypes
	http://code.google.com/p/pyzic/wiki/LibSndFilectypes
	ctypes based
	No compilation required
	numpy supported
	Windows only setup (fixable)
	long access to constants
	Not inplace read (creates an array every time)
